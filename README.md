I'm Varsha Prasad, an engineering student at the University of Waterloo who's currently working a duck ecosystem simulation in Unity. In recent years I've worked on Brain-Computer Interfaces and web developement. I've been a machine learning developer at Actionable.co where I used python for NLP projects and an internship at the BioRobotics Lab at UC Irvine where I used C# and MATLAB to do data analysis on EEG to find the correlation of proprioception and EEG data.
