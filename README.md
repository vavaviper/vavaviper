I'm Varsha Prasad, a grade 11 student. In recent years I've worked on Brain-Computer Interfaces and web developement. I've had an internship at the BioRobotics Lab at UC Irvine where I used C# and MATLAB to do data analysis on EEG to find the correlation of proprioception and EEG data. Iâ€™m currently working on improving my web dev skills with my personal website and ML skills with small proejcts with tensorflow.
