I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** based in **Toronto**, currently pursuing **Management Engineering (AI Option)** at **University of Waterloo**.  

I love building systems that combine **backend development** and **machine learning**, turning complex data and models into scalable, real-world solutions. Recently, I worked at **RBC**, developing ML pipelines, APIs, and GenAI monitoring tools to make financial systems smarter.  

Previously, I built **VR simulations for speech therapy**, worked on **neural networks from scratch**, and created full-stack applications and games. Always excited to **learn, build, and collaborate** on projects that push boundaries and make an impact.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, React, C#, Unity, SQL, R, MATLAB, MySQL  
**Frameworks & Tools:** FastAPI, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Firebase  
**Areas of Interest:** Machine Learning, Backend Development, Human-Computer Interaction, GenAI, Full-Stack Development

## ⚡ Highlights
- Built ML pipelines and production APIs at **RBC**, saving ~$5M/year in projected risk costs  
- Created immersive **VR therapy simulations** in Unity with custom finite state machines  
- Developed **full-stack apps and dashboards** for both research and commercial projects  
- Built a **neural network from scratch** achieving 96.7% accuracy on MNIST
